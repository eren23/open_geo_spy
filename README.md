# open geo spy

A very basic alternative open source implementation of the [GeoSpy](https://geospy.ai) platform.

Most of the code is sub optimal and not optimized for performance.

It sometimes works really well, but sometimes it doesn't.

Some concepts are just there for the sake of being there and probably degrading the performance.

My goals:

- Remove bias i introduced when trying to make it work :D
- Rereview all the ai written code and potentially replace it
- Experiment with different llms
- Use more location examples
- and more...

## Run

put requirements into .env file

```bash
docker compose up --build
```
